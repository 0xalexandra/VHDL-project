# VHDL-project
## Objective
This project is about designing, simplifying and implimenting digital logic circuits using Karnaugh Maps and VHDL. The first digital circuit outputs True when (x1=0 and x2=0) or (x2=1 and x3=0) or (x1=1 and x2=1 and x5=1), and the second and third output True when x2=1 or (x1=0 and x3=1).
